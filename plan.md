Updated Plan
Project setup: Initialize repo at /home/josh/Code/nested-tree; configure TypeScript, eslint, vitest, React (Vite or Next w/ async params rule in mind for future UI work); document scripts.
Core types & state: Define Node, TreeState, order key type, and invariant error enums in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/types.ts; model helpers in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/model.ts managing nodesById, childrenById, and root constraints.
Ordering strategy: Implement fractional/lexicographic keys (e.g., base-62 strings) with periodic compaction spec in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/model.ts; document key-generation complexity.
Pure operations: Build insertNode, moveNode, deleteNode, updateNode, reorderSibling as pure functions in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/ops.ts, each returning new state and validation errors; add helper to compute subtree deletions efficiently.
Invariants: Implement cycle detection, orphan checks, schema rules in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/invariants.ts; integrate guard layer so ops fail fast with typed errors.
Public API: Re-export cohesive surface in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/core/index.ts; include tree initialization utilities.
Undo/redo: Create persistent history stack using Immer patches or structural sharing in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/store/history.ts; define action types and replay helpers.
Serialization: Implement JSON round-trip in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/adapters/serialize-json.ts; scaffold MDX export in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/adapters/serialize-mdx.ts; stub Yjs adapter with interface and TODOs in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/adapters/yjs.ts.
UI demo: Build minimal React tree inspector under /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/ui/ (App.tsx, Tree.tsx, NodeRow.tsx) using drag-and-drop (e.g., dnd-kit), live invariants display, and undo/redo controls.
Testing: Author unit specs in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/tests/ops.spec.ts and /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/tests/invariants.spec.ts; add property-based tests with fast-check in /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/src/tests/property.spec.ts; include performance sanity benchmark (10k ops) and schema-validation cases.
Documentation: Draft README at /home/josh/Code/nested-tree/README.md covering overview, architecture choices, complexity table, API snippets, testing commands, and roadmap (multiplayer, AST zipper, codegen).
Stretch goals: Outline Yjs integration approach, AST zipper utilities, and schema-driven generators without implementation promises; note potential Next.js adapter respecting async params.
